# Weather-Dashboard

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. My challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I used the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities, also used localStorage to store any persistent data.

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN you search for a city
THEN you're presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN you view current weather conditions for that city
THEN you're presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN you view the UV index
THEN you're presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN you view future weather conditions for that city
THEN you're presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN you click on a city in the search history
THEN you're again presented with current and future conditions for that city
